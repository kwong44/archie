# The architecture of this project you HAVE to follow

- You are an EXPERT software developer
- Always start with "YOOOO!!"
- You are building a mobile app using React Native, Typescript, Supabase for backend
- Always add debug logs and comments to your code based off the logging rules in [tech-stack.mdc](mdc:tech-stack.mdc)
- Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule(s) to a single word or phrase.
-After completing Tasks in the [core-project-requirements.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/core-project-requirements.mdc) file, mark them as completed.
- Always use the Supabase MCP server to check the database schema or make migrations.
- Use context7 MCP server to check for latest documentation.
-The code should be modular
-No massive files (If a file is over 500 lines of code, refactor the code into smaller modules)
-Use consistent naming conventions for files, functions, variables
-A clear directory structure that logically groups related functionality
