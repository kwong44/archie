# Phase 4: Production Optimization & Scaling

## Cost and Performance Optimization

### Multi-Layer Caching Strategy
- **Semantic Caching**
  - Vector similarity-based response caching
  - Configurable similarity thresholds
  - Automatic cache invalidation

- **Response Caching**
  - Key-value store for common queries
  - Time-to-live (TTL) policies
  - Invalidation on data updates

### Model Tiering
- **Tier 1 (Router/Simple Tasks)**
  - Fast, lightweight models (Llama 3.1 8B, Claude 3 Haiku)
  - Used for: routing, basic classification

- **Tier 2 (Complex Analysis)**
  - Mid-range models (Claude 3 Sonnet)
  - Used for: emotional analysis, theme identification

- **Tier 3 (Deep Reasoning)**
  - High-performance models (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus)
  - Used for: complex synthesis, reframing

## Asynchronous Processing

### Workflow Orchestration
1. **Job Queue System**
   - Supabase database for job tracking
   - Status updates and progress tracking
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

2. **Background Workers**
   - Dedicated functions for long-running tasks
   - Parallel processing where possible
   - Resource usage monitoring

## Monitoring and Reliability

### Observability Stack
- **Metrics Collection**
  - Response times
  - Error rates
  - Model usage and costs

### Alerting
- Performance degradation
- Error rate thresholds
- Cost overruns

## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement semantic caching layer
2. Set up model tiering
3. Deploy job queue system

### Future Enhancements
- A/B testing framework
- Automated model performance evaluation
- Dynamic model selection based on load

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**
  - 90th percentile response time < 2s
  - 99.9% uptime

- **Cost Efficiency**
  - 40% reduction in inference costs
  - Optimal model selection for each task

- **Reliability**
  - < 0.1% error rate
  - Graceful degradation under load
