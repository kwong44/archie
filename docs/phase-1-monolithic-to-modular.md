# Phase 1: From Monolithic to Modular Architecture

## Current State Analysis
- Single Supabase Edge Function with monolithic prompt
- Handles all analysis in one LLM call
- Limited scalability and maintainability
- High risk of hallucination and task blending

## Key Problems Addressed
1. **Reliability Issues**
   - High cognitive load on LLM leads to inconsistent outputs
   - Increased risk of hallucination with complex, multi-task prompts
   - Difficulty in debugging and improving specific analysis components

2. **Scalability Challenges**
   - Single point of failure
   - Inefficient resource usage (all tasks use same model)
   - Difficult to update or modify individual analysis components

## Implementation Steps
1. **Decompose Monolithic Prompt**
   - Break down into focused, single-responsibility agents:
     - Emotional Analyst
     - Thematic Analyst
     - CBT Identifier
     - CBT Reframer

2. **Implement Sequential Pipeline**
   - Create dedicated functions for each analysis type
   - Chain outputs between functions
   - Implement error handling between steps

3. **Data Flow**
   ```

   → Emotional Analysis 
   → Thematic Analysis 
   → CBT Analysis (if needed)
   → Final Synthesis
   ```

## Success Metrics
- Improved accuracy in individual analysis components
- Reduced hallucination rates
- Easier debugging and iteration
- Better error isolation and handling

## Technical Requirements
- Update Supabase Edge Function structure
- Implement state management between steps
- Add comprehensive logging
- Set up monitoring for each analysis component
