# 🚀 OAuth Redirect Fix - Immediate Action Required

## The Issue
Your OAuth flow is working on Supabase's side, but the redirect URL is pointing to the wrong screen in your app.

## ✅ What I Fixed in Your Code:
1. **Updated login.tsx** - Changed redirect from `auth/callback` to `auth/success`
2. **Updated signup.tsx** - Changed redirect from `auth/callback` to `auth/success`  
3. **Optimized success.tsx** - Added delay for session establishment

## 🔧 What You Need to Update in Supabase:

### Step 1: Update Redirect URLs in Supabase
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Settings** > **Redirect URLs**
3. **Replace** the existing redirect URLs with:
   - **Development:** `exp://localhost:8081/success`
   - **Production:** `archie://success`

### Step 2: Update Site URL (if needed)
1. In the same **Authentication** > **Settings** section
2. Set **Site URL** to: `archie://`

## 🧪 Testing the Fix:

1. **Clear your app completely** and restart
2. Try Google sign in again
3. You should now be redirected to the success page
4. The success page should detect your session and redirect to onboarding

## 📋 Expected Flow:
1. User clicks Google sign in → Browser opens
2. User completes OAuth → Supabase redirects to `archie://auth/success`
3. Success page detects session → Auto-redirects to onboarding in 3 seconds
4. User continues with app setup

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work:

Check these potential issues:
1. **Clear app cache/data** completely
2. **Restart Expo development server**
3. **Check device logs** for any deep link errors
4. **Verify redirect URLs** are exactly as specified above

The OAuth logs show authentication is working - this redirect fix should resolve the navigation issue!
